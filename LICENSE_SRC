and hence the bellow copyright notice from Glucose is included.

NEOS also uses ABC as a binary for which the copyright notice is included bellow.

Glucose sources are based on MiniSat (see below MiniSat copyrights). Permissions and copyrights of
Glucose (sources until 2013, Glucose 3.0, single core) are exactly the same as Minisat on which it 
is based on. (see below).

Glucose-Syrup sources are based on another copyright. Permissions and copyrights for the parallel
version of Glucose-Syrup (the "Software") are granted, free of charge, to deal with the Software
without restriction, including the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute,
sublicence, and/or sell copies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is 
furnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:

- The above and below copyrights notices and this permission notice shall be included in all
copies or substantial portions of the Software;
- The parallel version of Glucose (all files modified since Glucose 3.0 releases, 2013) cannot
be used in any competitive event (sat competitions/evaluations) without the express permission of 
the authors (Gilles Audemard / Laurent Simon). This is also the case for any competitive event
using Glucose Parallel as an embedded SAT engine (single core or not).
